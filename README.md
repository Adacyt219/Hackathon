# Heartcoding-Hackathon-Event

## Welcome to the Heartcoding Hackathon

The Heartcoding is designed to be a mini "hackathon" for students with varying levels of experience. The focus of the hackathon will be the exploratory data analysis - or as we like to call it data storytelling - of the given *love related dataset*. We invite everyone who is interested in data science to participate, regardless of their technical background. This one day hackathon offers an interesting dataset to explore, guidance along the way, and free pizza!

**Disclaimer**: This is an EDA and not a ML competition, but ML solutions are welcomed.

*Dataset will be published on March 4th.

### Submission
- [Enroll in the submission platform](https://warwickdatasciencesociety.github.io/Heartcoding-Hackathon-Event/)
- [Guide to submit your project in Dicey Tech](https://diceytech.notion.site/Heard-Coding-Hackathon-db0207f3b8744bbb8b7c7ea97a231ae4)
- [Link to confirm your submission](https://forms.gle/QNCxgjH9CQzPDRNL9)
The competition will run from **1pm on Saturday the 4th March** to **6pm on Saturday the 4th March**. No preference will be given to early entrants.

### Judging and Winning

We will judge submissions based on the insights they derive. If you can tell a story about the data with basic code, but elaborate observations that's actually slightly better than a super technically advanced submission with no elaborations at all. We will be looking for a good balance between code, visualizations and elaborations.

The winning team will receive a shoutout on our [social media](#contact) accounts (including LinkedIn if you wish so). We will also link to your solution from this [GitHub](https://github.com/warwickdatasciencesociety) page.

## Help and Information

### FAQs

#### Is this a team or individual competition?

We will assign groups for participants according to the coding levels. There will be a balance for the levels in groups. Grab the chance to network with coders!

#### I've improved my data story-telling submission since last submitting. Can I resubmit?

No problem. Simply email [warwickdatasciencesociety@gmail.com](mailto:warwickdatasciencesociety@gmail.com) and explain the situation.

### Getting Help

Don't worry! We will provide help throughout the workshop on March 4th
